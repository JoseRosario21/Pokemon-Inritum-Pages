# Welcome to PokÃ©mon Inritum

![Inritum Background](assets/inritum_main_menu.png)

This is the official documentation and info hub for **PokÃ©mon Inritum**.

Here you will be able to find details about the custom fields used in battles, details about each hessian variant and zeta species.

We will also share development updates to keep you updated on the progress for the next release!

## About the game
In the land of **Hessia**, where some rare PokÃ©mon wield unimaginable strength, players are drawn into a gripping narrative that delves into the depths of existential philosophy.

As you journey through this richly crafted world, you'll uncover the mysteries of the region's troubled past and confront the dark machinations of a **nefarious religious cult**.

With the guidance of a renowned professor studying the genetic potential of PokÃ©mon, players must navigate a web of deception and betrayal, all while testing their skills in intense PokÃ©mon battles against formidable opponents.

Along the way, you'll encounter a cast of intriguing characters, each with their own motivations and agendas, as you unravel the secrets hidden within the **Zeta PokÃ©mon**.

But beware, for the cult's sinister leader, guided by the Philosophy of Redemption, seeks to harness the power of Arceus to bring about the end of existence itself.

**Will you stand against the tide of darkness? Or will you succumb to the allure of power and darkness, shaping the fate of the region and its inhabitants?**
