## Zeta Pokémon

Zeta Pokémon is a new gimmick in Pokémon Inritum. The plot is heavily tied to finding out more about this new condition so there won't be much detail here.

In terms of gameplay, it increases by 20% the 2 highest BST of the common species. Therefore, Zeta Pokémon are stronger their normal counterparts.

Due to plot reasons, there won't be any changes to the aspect of Zeta Pokémon, at least none very distinct, and they will always have the same abilities and movesets as the original species.

There might exist Zeta Regional Variant Pokémon in the future, making this species a lot stronger than the original one with custom typing, new abilities, and new movesets!
