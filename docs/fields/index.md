# Field Effects Documentation

This document provides an overview of the effects associated with various fields in the game.

Each field modifies the behavior of certain moves and/or conditions, providing unique tactical opportunities.

There will be common fields that are used in maps that are under the same criteria (forests, beaches, etc) and other maps that will be unique to specific battles such as gyms and legendary Pok√©mon.

On the left table you will find all our implemented fields and identify which one you need to read by their announcement.
